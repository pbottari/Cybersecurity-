- Kali
  - **Operating System**: Linux 2.6.32
  - **Purpose**: Pen testing machine
  - **IP Address**: 191.168.1.90
  
- Capstone
  - **Operating System**: Linux
  - **Purpose**: Alert testing machine
  - **IP Address**: 191.168.1.105
  
- Elk
  - **Operating System**: Linux
  - **Purpose**: Gather logs and alerts: elasticsearch, logstack, kibana.
  - **IP Address**: 191.168.1.100
  
 
### Description of Targets
 
The target of this attack was: 192.168.1.110
 
Target 1 is an Apache web server and has SSH enabled, so ports 80 and 22 are possible ports of entry for attackers. As such, the following alerts have been implemented:
 
### Monitoring the Targets
 
Traffic to these services should be carefully monitored. To this end, we have implemented the alerts below:
 
#### HTTP request size monitor
Alert 1 is implemented as follows:
  - **Metric**:  WHEN sum() of http.request.bytes OVER all documents
  - **Threshold**: above 3500 for the last 1 minute
  - **Vulnerability Mitigated**: HTTP request smuggling, SQL injection, cross-site scriping, brute force attack.
  - **Reliability**: medium or high depending on the HTTP method, can genrate both false negatives and false positives.
  
#### Excessive HTTP errors
Alert 2 is implemented as follows:
  - **Metric**: WHEN count() Grouped OVER top 5 http.response.status_code
  - **Threshold**: Above 400 for the last 5 minutes
  - **Vulnerability Mitigated**: brute force attack, DoS/DDoS.
  - **Reliability**: medium to high, could generate false positives.
  
#### CPU usage monitor
Alert 3 is implemented as follows:
  - **Metric**: WHen max() of system.process.cpu.total.pct OVER all documents
  - **Threshold**: Above 0.5 for the last 5 minutes
  - **Vulnerability Mitigated**: hidden processes running in the background
  - **Reliability**: high, keep network at normal speed and traffic, does not generate false positives or negatives. 
 
### Suggestions for Going Further
 
Each alert above pertains to a specific vulnerability/exploit. Recall that alerts only detect malicious behavior, but do not stop it. For each vulnerability/exploit identified by the alerts above, a patch was suggested.

The logs and alerts generated during the assessment suggest that this network is susceptible to several active threats, identified by the alerts above. In addition to watching for occurrences of such threats, the network should be hardened against them. The Blue Team suggests that IT implement the fixes below to protect the network:

- Vulnerability 1 - Brute force attack
  - **Patch**:  update password policy to enforce the use of complex and long passwords
  - **Why It Works**: decrease changes for passwords to be cracked.
  
- Vulnerability 2 - HTTP request size monitor
  - **Patch**: apply available patch
  - **Why It Works**: special-security-package to fix the vulnerability.
  
- Vulnerability 3 - Wordpress vulnerabilities
  - **Patch**: update worpress to the latest version available, install WAF (web application firewall) and security plugins, move wordpress yto SSL/HTTPS.
  - **Why It Works**: The WAF will filter and monitor HTTP traffic, protection against attacks such as DDos, XSS, SQL injection, malware, etc. Vulmnerabilities from previous versions will be patched. 
  
### Kibana 
There were a total of 338 alerts for the 3 alerts setup during the attack to target 1.
