# Network Analysis
## Time Thieves
At least two users on the network have been wasting time on YouTube. Usually, IT wouldn't pay much mind to this behavior, but it seems these people have created their own web server on the corporate network. So far, Security knows the following about these time thieves:
- They have set up an Active Directory network.
- They are constantly watching videos on YouTube.
- Their IP addresses are somewhere in the range 10.6.12.0/24.

The following information was captured from the traffic analysis:
- The domain name of the users' custom site is  FRANK-N-TED.COM        
- The IP address of the Domain Controller (DC) of the AD network is 10.6.12.12
- The name of the malware downloaded to the 10.6.12.203 machines june11.dll
- The file was uploaded to VirusTotal.com and it indicated that the malware was a DOS.EXE
