### Network Topology
 
The following machines were identified on the network:
- Target 1
  - **Operating System**: Linux 3.x/4.x
  - **Purpose**: Webserver - Vulnerable VM
  - **IP Address**: 192.168.1.110
  
- Kali
  - **Operating System**: Linux 2.6.32
  - **Purpose**: Pen testing machine
  - **IP Address**: 191.168.1.90
  
- Capstone
  - **Operating System**: Linux
  - **Purpose**: Alert testing machine
  - **IP Address**: 191.168.1.105
  
- Elk
  - **Operating System**: Linux
  - **Purpose**: Gather logs and alerts: elasticsearch, logstack, kibana.
  - **IP Address**: 191.168.1.100
  
 
### Description of Targets
 
The target of this attack was: 192.168.1.110
 
Target 1 is an Apache web server and has SSH enabled, so ports 80 and 22 are possible ports of entry for attackers. As such, the following alerts have been implemented:
 
### Monitoring the Targets
 
Traffic to these services should be carefully monitored. To this end, we have implemented the alerts below:
 
#### HTTP request size monitor
Alert 1 is implemented as follows:
  - **Metric**: http.request.bytes
  - **Threshold**: above 3500 for the last 1 minute
  - **Vulnerability Mitigated**: upload or download of large packets, related to brute force attack. 
  - **Reliability**: High: alerts when user is trying to request specific contents from server.
  
#### Excessive HTTP errors
Alert 2 is implemented as follows:
  - **Metric**: http.response.status_code
  - **Threshold**: Above 400 for the last 5 minutes
  - **Vulnerability Mitigated**: trial and error to guess login information.
  - **Reliability**: High: provides critical data to prevent brute force attacks.
 
#### CPU usage monitor
Alert 3 is implemented as follows:
  - **Metric**: system.process.cpu.total.pct
  - **Threshold**: Above 0.5 for the last 5 minutes
  - **Vulnerability Mitigated**: DDoS attacks
  - **Reliability**: High: keep network at normal speed and traffic.
 
### Suggestions for Going Further
 
Each alert above pertains to a specific vulnerability/exploit. Recall that alerts only detect malicious behavior, but do not stop it. For each vulnerability/exploit identified by the alerts above, a patch was suggested.

The logs and alerts generated during the assessment suggest that this network is susceptible to several active threats, identified by the alerts above. In addition to watching for occurrences of such threats, the network should be hardened against them. The Blue Team suggests that IT implement the fixes below to protect the network:
- Vulnerability 1 - Brute force attack
  - **Patch**: setup a whitelist of IP addresses 
  - **Why It Works**: Because you restrict access to the IPs on the list.
  
- Vulnerability 2 - HTTP request size monitor
  - **Patch**: apply available patch
  - **Why It Works**: special-security-package to fix the vulnerability.
  
- Vulnerability 3 - DDos attack
  - **Patch**: install WAF (web application firewall)
  - **Why It Works**: The WAF will filter and monitor HTTP traffic, protection against attackes such as DDos, XSS, SQL injection, etc.
